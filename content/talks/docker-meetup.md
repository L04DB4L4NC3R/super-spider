In 2019, one of my projects were selected for showcase at the Docker Chennai Meetup by the Collabnix community, under the supervision of the Docker Captain [Ajeet Singh Raina](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajeetsraina/), who was organizing both the Chennai as well as the Bangalore meetups at that time. 

This meetup was attended by 40+ industry professionals who were were eager to know about how I used docker to build, scale and deploy my application on the cloud. This application was [Project Hades](https://github.com/GDGVIT/Project-Hades), which was being used, at the time, to handle the workloads of 2,000 event attendees at the time. The following topics were discussed:

* Docker with golang
* Multi-stage docker builds
* Optimizing docker images with alpine distribution
* Optimizing deployment
