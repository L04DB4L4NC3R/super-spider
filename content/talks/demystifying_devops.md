Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean.
Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community! Four quality pull requests must be submitted to public GitHub repositories. You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.

IOTA from IIIT Sri City organized Hacktoberfest Meetup in 2020, which was a three-day-long event for introducing beginners to the world of open source with the aim to make students familiar with some of the tools and technologies used by open source projects. 

I talked about what is DevOps and how it has impacted applications developers and made them think about how to optimize their software to be infra-aware.
