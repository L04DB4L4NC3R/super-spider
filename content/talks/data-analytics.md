To make sense of bytes of bytes of metadata, is downright tedious. That's why we implement machines to make our life easier, while they develop themselves as they process more data. This technology has revolutionised how we look at problems, and how we analyse them.
We at CodeChef-VIT will clear any and all of your queries at our Data Analytics workshop. Make sure you're there!

I was a co-speaker during this event, along with [Ekansh](https://www.instagram.com/focdot/), our data engineer at the time. This event happened on the same day as my Blockchain fundamental event. In lieu of that, I talked about how we can integrate data analytics on blockchain based platforms in order to create hybrid as well as secure models on intelligence and crypto exchange. This was a 3 hour session with over 250+ attendees.
