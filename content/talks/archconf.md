During the weekend of 10th and 11th of October there was an online Arch Linux conference. My talk was selected in their call for participation

All talks were expected to be recorded as it would ease the planning for the live portion of the stream, however there was a live Q&A session with the presenters. 

I talked about Custom Kernels in Edge Computing Devices in 2020. [Here is the link to my presentation slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pIvzk4KDbyw5RtHDCNwD7Bri_ziS0Qk9P88hVL3Z1V4/edit?usp=sharing)
