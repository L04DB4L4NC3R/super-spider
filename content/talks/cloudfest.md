I took a session on Cloud technologies and the Google Compute Engine along with [Dhiraj Kumar Jain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thealgo/) for the same. We had a crowd of over 100 interested attendees who were all part of the hands on learning session using Qwiklabs.

We were proud to say that all of our attendees earned a qwiklabs badge before leaving our session, and walked away with a month of free Qwiklabs credits.
