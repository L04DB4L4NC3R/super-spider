During the summer break of 2019, a lot of members of the CodeChef-VIT community were doing web development, due to which a lot of people were facing problems integrating frontend to the backend. So I, along with [Yash Mehrotra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yashmehrotra9/) of the CodeChef-VIT board made a proactive decision to take a session on consuming APIs.

This session was attended by the whole community and they got to learn about the following concepts:

* Jquery
* Ajax
* Promises
* Emmet for efficient web development
* REST APIs
