Global Developers' Summit was an online conference organized by C4 Projects during the lockdown period of 2020. It had a panel of more than 25 different speakers talking about topics like deep learning, startup culture and cloud technologies. Enter the Denoland is a webinar which explores the new and popular runtime for typescript and javascript in a code-along format.

The talk began with me explaining about Deno v/s Node.js then diving deeper into the code of Deno and building a blogging application. The template can be found [here](kutt.it/deno-mvc).
