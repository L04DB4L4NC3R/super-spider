I was doing some digging and checking out varius RSS feeds and figured out that you can actually link your Medium articles to DEV! So whenever you publish something on Medium, the article is automatically added to your DEV dashboard as a draft. This can be done with other RSS providers also (not just medium). To enable this feature simply go to your DEV settings, to this page:

Expect to see some of my popular medium articles on DEV in the coming few days :)
