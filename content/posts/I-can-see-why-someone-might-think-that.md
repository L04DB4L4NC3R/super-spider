I can see why someone might think that. Domain Driven Design (DDD) was designed to keep the domain model at the core of the whole project. Clean Architecture, though derived from the DDD ideology, is a more modern approach to complex problems where we might have more than one type of user interface.

Clean Architecture is explicitly designed to be interface agnostic, in addition to the offerings of DDD. Also, Domain Driven Design introduces DAOs (Data Access Objects) whereas *services* in Clean Architecture are a more expressive approach.
